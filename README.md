# Gender Pay Gap Analysis — Paraguay

This project analyzes income disparities by gender across occupations using official data from Paraguay’s Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas (INE).

## Contents

- Data cleaning and processing of key columns:
  - `gender` (1 = Men, 6 = Women)
  - `main_monthly_income` (income in Guaraníes)
  - `occupation_category` (coded categories)

## Occupation Codes

| Code | Occupation Label            |
|-------|----------------------------|
| '1'   | Public employee / worker   |
| '2'   | Private employee / worker  |
| '3'   | Employer or boss           |
| '4'   | Self-employed worker       |
| '5'   | Unpaid family worker       |
| '6'   | Domestic worker            |

Codes such as `9` (NR), `NA`, and `Blanco` are excluded from the analysis.

## Purpose

To provide clear, data-driven insights that reveal the persistent gender pay gap in Paraguay, encouraging informed discussion and action.
